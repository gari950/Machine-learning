Data Transformation : Data transformation is the process of changing the format, structure, or values of data. Processes such as data integration, 
data migration, data warehousing, and data wrangling all involve data transformation. Data is transformed to make it better- organised. Transformed data may be 
easier for both humans and computers to use.

Data Transformation

Normalization: Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. The goal of normalization is to change the 
values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values.

Normalization is a scaling technique in which values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1. It is also known as Min-Max scaling.

Formula for Normalization:
