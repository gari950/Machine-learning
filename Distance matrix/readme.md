Tools: Python

Theory: 

A distance matrix is a table that shows the distance between pairs of objects. For example, in the table below we can see a distance of 16 between A and B, of 47 
between A and C, and so on. By definition, an objectâ€™s distance from itself, which is shown in the main diagonal of the table, is 0. Distance matrices are sometimes 
called dissimilarity matrices.
Data can be recorded in a distance matrix at the time of collection. For example, in some studies of perception, people are asked to rate the psychological distance
between pairs of objects, and these distances are recorded in a distance matrix.
More commonly, a distance matrix is computed from a raw data table. 
**In the example below, we can use high school math (Pythagoras) to work out that the distance between A and B is**

We can use the same formula with more than two variables, and this is known as the Euclidean distance.
Distance matrices and dissimilarity matrices
All distance matrices are dissimilarity matrices, but not all dissimilarity matrices are distance matrices. The distances shown in a distance matrix are proportional
to each other. If the distance between A and B is twice the distance between A and C, that means that B is twice as far from A as is C. By contrast, in a dissimilarity
matrix the values may only reflect relative differences.
