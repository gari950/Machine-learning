Tools: Python

# Theory: 

Outlier-An Outlier is a data-item/object that deviates significantly from the rest of the (so-called normal) objects. They can be caused by measurement or
execution errors. The analysis for outlier detection is referred to as outlier mining. There are many ways to detect the outliers, and the removal process is the
data frame same as removing a data item from the pandaâ€™s data frame.
Here pandas data frame is used for a more realistic approach as in real-world project need to detect the outliers arouse during the data analysis step, the same 
approach can be used on lists and series-type objects.

Noisy data- Noisy data is meaningless data. The term has often been used as a synonym for corrupt data. However, its meaning has expanded to include any data that
cannot be understood and interpreted correctly by machines, such as unstructured text. Any data that has been received, stored, or changed in such a manner that it
cannot be read or used by the program that originally created it can be described as noisy.
