What is Data Redundancy?
During data integration in data mining, various data stores are used. This can lead to the problem of redundancy in data. An attribute (column or feature of data set) 
is called redundant if it can be derived from any other attribute or set of attributes. Inconsistencies in attribute or dimension naming can also lead to the 
redundancies in data set.

What is Correlation?
(to be exact Correlation in Statistic) is a measure of a mutual relationship between two variables whether they are causal or not. This degree of measurement
could be measured on any kind of data type (Continous and Continous, Categorical and Categorical, Continous and Categorical).
