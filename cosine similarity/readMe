Theory:

Cosine similarity is a metric, helpful in determining, how similar the data objects are irrespective of their size. We can measure the similarity between two sentences in Python using Cosine Similarity. In cosine similarity, data objects in a dataset are treated as a vector. The formula to find the cosine similarity between two vectors is –
Cos (x, y) = x . y / ||x|| * ||y|| where,
•	x . y = product (dot) of the vectors ‘x’ and ‘y’.
•	||x|| and ||y|| = length of the two vectors ‘x’ and ‘y’.
•	||x|| * ||y|| = cross product of the two vectors ‘x’ and ‘y’.
